# unityGame
 unity game done in 2 months with 3 random people.
 
 
 Had to learn C# and Unity in 2 months while creating a game for a competition. In my group we had two artists and one unemployed person with no technical or artistic background.
 
 I did all the code and game design while the others were responsible for the art and map layout. There are a lot of bugs and some constraints forced upon me due to my teams 
 abilites, examples being overpromising on sprites and sound effects or saying they knew how to animate which ended up being my responsibility. Didn't do the menu which doesn't link to the next scene so I've just left it as is and just have this as some examples of my C#. If you want to try playing then you need to start from scene demoroom and the 'door' is one of the barrels......
