# unityGame
 unity game done in 2 months with 3 random people.
 
 
 Had to learn C# and Unity in 2 months while creating a game for a competition. In my group we had two artists and one unemployed person with no technical or artistic background.
 
 I did all the code and game design while the others were responsible for the art and map layout. There are a lot of bugs and some constraints forced upon my due to my teams 
 abilites, examples being overpromising on sprites and sound effects.
